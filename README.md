## Note

The challenges of feature noise and label noise in machine learning are intricately linked. Many methods that address one type of noise often have implications for the other. For instance, techniques developed for handling noisy labels can sometimes be adapted to manage noisy features, and vice versa. Addressing both types of noise is crucial for developing robust machine learning models that perform well on real-world data.
